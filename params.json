  "body": "### Why?\r\nTiA (TOBI interface A) is a proposal for a standardized interface to transmit raw biosignals, with a focus on BCI (brain-computer interface) systems. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Multirate transfer\r\n* TCP or UDP data transmission possible\r\n* Block-oriented transfer\r\n* Division into various signal types\r\n* Multiple clients\r\n* Low resource requirements\r\n* Exchange of meta-information between client and server\r\n* Currently in development: Connection based channel selection and downsampling\r\n\r\n\r\n###  Code\r\nThe TiA library is written in C++. The Code is available [here](https://github.com/tools4BCI/TiA).\r\nTo get r/w access to the TiA repository, please get in touch with: Christian Breitwieser -- c.breitwieser(at)tugraz(dot)at \r\n\r\n### Building the TiA library \r\n####Linux & Co. \t\t\r\nUnder a Linux or Unix based distribution, the TiA library is utilizing the [qmake](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-manual.html) build system from the [Qt](https://www.qt.io) library. The respective '.pro' and '.pri' files (qmake config files) are included in the SignalServer repo. It is suggested to use the [Qt Creater](https://www.qt.io/ide/) as an IDE under Linux, as it fully supports qmake.\r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\nThe TiA library source is shipped with a Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 solution file (.sln) and the needed project files (.vcxproj) to build the SignalServer. This solution files are also suitable for the Visual C++ Express Edition. \r\n\r\n##### TiA library dependencies:\r\n[boost-libs](http://www.boost.org/): system, thread, date_time\r\n\r\n_Using Linux, those libraries are usually included in the repositories of the respective distributions._\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* Doxygen doku (public interface -- for library users)\r\n* Doxygen doku (complete TiA library -- for library developers)\r\n* [TiA specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4717)\r\n* [IEEE TiA paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6111272) describing the intention and the features of TiA (restricted access)\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\nThe authors are grateful to **Christoph Eibel**, who spent many hours refactoring the whole TiA communication and also to **Andreas Schuller**, who wrote the very first version of TiA.\r\n\r\n###Licencing\r\nTiA is dual-licenced under the [LGPL version 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html) and under the Graz University of Technology Commercial License Agreement provided with the Software or, alternatively, in accordance with the terms contained in a written agreement between you and Graz University of Technology. \r\n",
